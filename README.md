Library Media Management System

The library operates as a digital and physical space where members can borrow various media items, such as books, movies, and music CDs. The library tracks media loans, reviews provided by members, and details about the creators of the media. Additionally, the system manages the internal structure of the library by organizing employees and media items into different sections. The goal is to ensure smooth library operations, including member engagement, media item management, staff allocation, and media categorization.
